project title  student blog

  I built an application that mekelle university students, Registrars and almuni can share their
experience, campus life. so the main aim of the application is to empower students by thinking
  that there is a community that they can share their ideas(business or scholarship), learn from
  

Functionalities

It is easy to use
 When a user signs in, it means they can both write and read articles. I have created seven 
categories that students can write in and read from. When a user wants to write an article, 
they are prompted to choose a category, which I store as an attribute in Firebase. 
This attribute helps me fetch the articles later. Similarly, when a user selects a category to read,
I use the category attribute to display the relevant articles in their activities

A user can search by title
A user can edit his profile and add bio, occupation, university completed year.  by clicking person
    Icon at bottom
At top there are seven categories, so when a user clicks the icon on them they will navigate him to their 
    corresponding activity
A user can like an article
